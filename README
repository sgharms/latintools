This is a project for tools that help you write Latin more easily.

Tools fall into these varieties:

1.  Tools that change LaTeX characters into Unicode characters with macrons
2.  Textmate modes that allow you to use ^a to generate LaTeX codes like \={a}
3.  LaTeX styles that help with the annotation of verse
