This is a project for tools that help you write Latin more easily.

Tools fall into these varieties:

  + LaTeX_tools
    -  LaTeX styles that help with the annotation of verse
  + Textmate_tools
     - Latin Student.tmbundle
       A Textmate bundle that is used to speed up typing of Latin text.

       1.  In a LaTeX file, entering control+[aeiou] or [AEIOU] will result in
	   a LaTeX macron glyph (e.g. \={a}).  This allows you to touch-type
	   text in without fear
       2.  Contains the "Dactylize" method which takes glyphs with macrons, and
	   then, above them, suspends another long mark automatically.  When
	   doing scansion, this will allow your long vowels to have a macron AND
	   for you to have another long mark 2 units above so that, when
           combined with short marks, you can have a full, beautifully typeset 
	   scansion line.
  + Shell_tools
    - Tools that change LaTeX characters into Unicode characters with macrons
